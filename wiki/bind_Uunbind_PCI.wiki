=  Bind and Unbind a PCI device to device driver =

Manual driver binding and unbinding can be done with this feature

In sysfs tree, every driver now has bind and unbind files associated with it


==  Verify which driver has been bind to the device using the tree==

root@ankit-laptop:/# tree /sys/bus/pci/drivers/e1000/  

/sys/bus/pci/drivers/e1000/

|-- 0000:00:03.0 -> ../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.0

|-- 0000:00:08.0 -> ../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:08.0

|-- bind

|-- module -> ../../../../module/e1000

3 directories, 5 files



==  Unbinding a device from a driver. Write the bus id of the device to unbind file==
