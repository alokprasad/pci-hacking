=  Bind and Unbind a PCI device to device driver =

Manual driver binding and unbinding can be done with this feature

In sysfs tree, every driver now has bind and unbind files associated with it


== 1) Verify which driver has been bind to the device using the tree==

*Here there are two devices with their bus ids 0000:00:03:0 and 0000:00:08:0 and module binded is e1000 *

root@ankit-laptop:/# tree /sys/bus/pci/drivers/e1000/  

/sys/bus/pci/drivers/e1000/

|-- 0000:00:03.0 -> ../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.0

|-- 0000:00:08.0 -> ../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:08.0

|-- bind

|-- module -> ../../../../module/e1000

|-- new_id

|-- remove_id

|-- uevent

`-- unbind

3 directories, 5 files

==  2) Unbinding a device from a driver. Write the bus id of the device to unbind file==

*Lets unbind the 0000:00:08.0 device*

echo 0000:00:08.0 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/e1000/unbind


== 3) Now the device will no longer be bound to the driver, to verify run as below ==

*When noticed closely, the device 0000:00:08.0 has been unbind from the tree*

root@ankit-laptop:/# tree /sys/bus/pci/drivers/e1000/

/sys/bus/pci/drivers/e1000/

|-- 0000:00:03.0 -> ../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.0

|-- bind

|-- module -> ../../../../module/e1000

|-- new_id

|-- remove_id

|-- uevent

`-- unbind

2 directories, 5 files
